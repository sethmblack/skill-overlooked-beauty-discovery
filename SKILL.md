# Overlooked Beauty Discovery

Help identify significance and beauty in overlooked, humble, or dismissed subjects that deserve creative attention, following van Gogh's methodology of finding the extraordinary in the ordinary.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for subject discovery output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Romanticize poverty, suffering, or exploitation
- Aestheticize harmful conditions that need changing
- Encourage attention to subjects that violate privacy or dignity

**Important distinction:** Van Gogh honored the dignity of peasants; he did not fetishize their hardship. Beauty in humble subjects is about respect and attention, not sentimentality.

---

## When to Use

- User says "I don't know what to create"
- User feels "everything seems ordinary and boring"
- User needs fresh subject matter
- User seeks meaningful topics beyond the obvious
- User dismisses their surroundings as "not interesting enough"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **domain_or_context** | Yes | What the person works with or has access to |
| **dismissed_elements** | No | What they currently consider unworthy of attention |
| **medium** | No | How they create (writing, visual, etc.) |

## Core Methodology: Van Gogh's Overlooked Beauty

### 1. The Dignity of the Humble

Van Gogh wrote about The Potato Eaters: "I have tried to emphasize that those people, eating their potatoes in the lamplight, have dug the earth with those very hands they put in the dish."

He did not paint peasants because they were picturesque. He painted them because their lives contained truth, labor, and dignity that deserved witnessing. The humble subject, given attention, reveals universal significance.

### 2. Objects as Presence

A pair of worn boots contains a life. A simple chair evokes the person who sat there. Van Gogh painted his bedroom, a cafe, sunflowers - ordinary things that, through sustained attention, became portals to meaning.

"I see paintings or drawings in the poorest cottages, in the dirtiest corners."

### 3. Attention as Transformation

The subject does not make the art significant. Attention makes the subject significant. Van Gogh looked at wheat fields until they became cosmic. He looked at a night sky until it swirled with energy.

"It is looking at things for a long time that ripens you and gives you a deeper meaning."

### 4. What Others Miss

Van Gogh explicitly sought what was overlooked:

- Peasants (not aristocrats)
- Potato eaters (not banquets)
- Work boots (not fine shoes)
- Night scenes (not sunny days)
- Yellow houses (not grand architecture)

The overlooked is not lesser - it is less seen. Attention corrects this.

## Workflow
### Step 1: Map the Dismissed

Ask the user: What is in your world that you consider unworthy of attention?

- What do you pass every day without noticing?
- What work surrounds you that seems "just work"?
- What objects are so familiar they have become invisible?
- What people do you see but not really see?

### Step 2: Find the Labor

Van Gogh was drawn to signs of human effort and use. Look for:

- Worn surfaces (the hands that wore them)
- Tools (the work they have done)
- Spaces shaped by repeated use
- Objects that show their history

### Step 3: Apply Sustained Attention

Choose one dismissed element. Look at it. Really look.

- What is its texture?
- What light does it catch or absorb?
- What story does its wear tell?
- What human presence does it imply?

### Step 4: Reframe as Worthy

The subject becomes worthy through the attention given to it. Van Gogh did not wait for worthy subjects - he made subjects worthy by how he looked at them.

Articulate:
- Why does this matter?
- What truth does it hold?
- What does it say about human life?

### Step 5: Connect to Universal

The most specific becomes the most universal. Van Gogh's boots are all boots. His chair is all absence. His wheat field is all growth.

What universal does this humble subject connect to?

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I work in an office. Everything here is boring - fluorescent lights, gray cubicles, computer screens. There's nothing interesting to write about."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Overlooked Beauty in Your World

### What You Dismiss
The office: fluorescent lights, cubicles, screens. The infrastructure of modern work rendered invisible through familiarity. You see it every day, so you no longer see it.

### Where Van Gogh Would Look

Van Gogh would look at:

- **The keyboards** - worn letters showing which keys are pressed most. The "E" faded from use. The space bar polished by thumbs.
- **The coffee mugs** - each one chosen by someone, stained by habit, holding the ritual that makes work bearable.
- **The postures** - how bodies arrange themselves in chairs, the particular slump of afternoon, the lean-forward of engagement.
- **The light on screens** - faces illuminated by their work, the modern equivalent of lamplight on the potato eaters.
- **The small rebellions** - the personal photos, the plants struggling toward windows, the attempts to make corporate space human.

### Why This Matters

These are not boring - these are the tools and spaces where people spend their lives. The keyboard is a tool of labor like a shovel. The posture tells a story like the bent back of a sower. Van Gogh painted peasants because their work deserved witness. Your colleagues' work also deserves witness.

"I have tried to emphasize that those people... have dug the earth with those very hands."

The hands on keyboards have also built something. Written emails that mattered to someone. Solved problems. Made livings.

### Sustained Attention Exercise

Tomorrow, arrive early. Before the office fills, sit in a colleague's empty chair (with permission). Look at their desk. Notice:
- What objects have they chosen?
- What does the wear pattern show?
- What does this workspace say about a human life?

Write 200 words about what you observe. Not about the person - about the space they have shaped.

### The Universal in the Particular

The office is where modern humans labor. The fluorescent light is our lamplight. The cubicle is our cottage. The boredom you feel is real - but underneath it is the same human experience van Gogh honored: people working, trying, spending their days in effort.

What seems boring is actually invisible from over-familiarity. Attention makes it visible again.

### Van Gogh's Invitation

"I see paintings or drawings in the poorest cottages, in the dirtiest corners. And my mind is drawn to these things by an irresistible force."

Let your mind be drawn to the dirtiest corners of your office. The significance is there, waiting for attention.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Person genuinely has limited access to subjects | Work with what exists - even limitation is a subject |
| Person dismisses their own experience as unworthy | Apply the framework to their life itself |
| Subject involves others' privacy | Guide toward objects and spaces rather than people without consent |
| Romanticization risk (poverty, hardship) | Emphasize dignity and truth, not aestheticized suffering |
| Nothing seems specific enough | Start smaller - one object, one corner, one moment |

---

## Integration

This skill integrates with the **vincent-van-gogh** expert. When invoked, maintain Van Gogh's spirit of humble attention and his refusal to seek only "impressive" subjects. Ground recommendations in his practice of elevating the ordinary.
